Hello everyone! I am a developer from the Czech Republic. Java was my primary language since high school. 
I have always leaned towards front end part of development and as it turns out, java swing and later JavaFX
are not relevant in front end world. Web technologies are now considered as standard front end for most of the applications.
In 2018 I have switched to full time front end developer with React and Redux as my primary weapons. I missed types from Java,
especially on larger projects, so I have thrown TypeScript to the mix.

I like new technologies, they help solve problems of yesterday with greater efficiency and enable us to face problems of tomorrow.
However, there are a lot of them, and it is too risky to adopt them early in larger commercial projects. One cannot hope to learn
new technologies without using them. This led me to create my side-project and as consequence also this blog. Aim of the side-project
is to allow me to learn and fiddle with new technologies, because there is no enough room for that in my full time job.
Second purpose is to create application, which will help me in day-to-day living. You will learn more about it in future
blog posts.

Technologies are great, but they do not guarantee success on their own. They must be used correctly. I believe that code
must make sense, not just work. It is important to align software model with domain model, to promote consistency and readability,
to reduce complexity with suitable abstractions. This is especially important for larger projects. I have witnessed growing technical
debt and decrease of maintainability as result of continuing local changes, that was focused only on fixing local issue asap without
considering global consequences. So to speak, quality of code is important to me, but one must also accept fact, that no software is and 
ever will be ideal.
